Is it just me, or has everyone suddenly become a systems thinker?

I started noticing the language of "systems,” especially the word "coherence" popping up in my ChatGPT sessions lately.

Admittedly, I work in strategy and AI, and I’m literally reading a book on Systems Thinking right now. My first thought was "frequency illusion bias." I’m seeing it because I’m looking for it.

But then I started seeing the exact same framing in my LinkedIn feed.

And not just from strategists.

I saw "coherence" and "systems" language coming from educators. From hospitality leaders. From wellness coaches. Even from metaphysicists.

So, I dug in a bit.

I realized there are may be two forces colliding here.

First, there is a technical bias.

Large Language Models are probabilistic. 

They are designed to predict the next likely token.
• Specific words are risky (they might be factually wrong).
• Abstract words are safe (they fit many contexts).

Words like "coherence," "alignment," and "ecosystem" are High-Status Abstractions. They sound authoritative and sophisticated, but they carry very low risk of being "incorrect." They are safe, presentable, and accepted everywhere.

Second, there is a cultural shift.

Ten years ago, the algorithms (and our culture) rewarded Kinetic Authority. Words like disrupt, hustle, hack, crush.

Today, we seem to crave Static Authority. Words like align, steward, ground, coherence.
Maybe it’s because we’re tired. We don't want to break things anymore; we want to hold them together. The AI detects that preference for stability and feeds it back to us.

To test this theory, I ran an experiment.

I asked ChatGPT to write a "future-facing manifesto" for three completely different professions: a Cloud Architect, a Brand Strategist, and a Reiki Healer (with memory off).

The results were wild. 

The AI applied the exact same "systems" template to all three:
• The Cloud Architect: "The future architect... values coherence over fashion."
• The Brand Strategist: "The era of the slogan is over. The era of coherence has begun."
• The Reiki Healer: "A quiet technology of human coherence."

The AI gave the Engineer a soul, and the Mystic a structural framework. They met exactly in the middle.

So, where does this leave us?

On one hand, there is the risk of a Beige Singularity—a world where distinct expertise is smoothed out into a mush of agreeable, abstract sounds. If a Brand Strategy and a Reiki session sound identical, we might be losing the critical precision that makes those disciplines work.

But there is another possibility.
We live in a deeply fragmented world. We work in silos.

If AI is giving us a shared "systems" vocabulary—a common tongue for the Architect, the Healer, and the CEO—maybe that isn't a bug. Maybe it’s a feature.

If we are indeed tired of breaking things and want to be held together, perhaps this semantic convergence has value. It offers a way to see the structural rhymes between a cloud server and a nervous system.

The challenge for us is to ensure we are using these words to build real bridges, not just to paint over the cracks.

That is the balance I’m aiming for this year.

I plan to dive deeper into AI and systems thinking—experimenting with the tools and the language. But I’m setting the intention to remain mindful of the systems I’m operating in, and the precise meaning of the words I use to describe them.
