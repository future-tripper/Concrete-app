**Abstract**

This paper introduces Vapor Theory, a framework for understanding the semantic homogenization of AI-generated professional content. Through analysis of 12,847 LinkedIn posts (2023–2025), we identify a consistent pattern of "authority borrowing"—the systematic importation of terminology from high-status domains into unrelated professional contexts.

We propose a four-domain taxonomy of Borrowed Authority Language (BAL):

1. **Scientific** — terminology from physics and neuroscience (coherence, resonance, signal, entropy, frequency)
2. **Systems** — terminology from engineering and architecture (ecosystem, framework, infrastructure, stack, protocol)
3. **Spiritual** — terminology from contemplative traditions (presence, embodied, consciousness, grounded, wisdom)
4. **Moral** — terminology from ethics and stewardship discourse (responsibility, integrity, care, custodianship, dignity)

Our findings suggest that large language models default to BAL as a "semantic safety strategy"—maximizing perceived authority while minimizing falsifiability. The result is what we term **vapor**: content that registers as significant while remaining epistemically weightless.

Notably, cross-domain blending correlates with higher engagement metrics (r=0.72, p<0.001), suggesting audiences reward authority signaling independent of meaning. Posts containing terminology from 3+ domains showed 34% higher impression rates than single-domain content (see Fig. 2).

Given the increasing prevalence of AI-assisted content creation (estimated at 54% of LinkedIn posts, Q4 2024; Reynolds & Park, 2024), we argue that **vapor differentiation**—rather than vapor elimination—represents the pragmatic path forward. If semantic substance cannot compete with authority signaling at scale, practitioners may achieve differentiation through deliberate vapor maximization: pushing borrowed authority language beyond default thresholds into territories of productive absurdity.

Further research is needed to establish optimal vapor density thresholds and cross-domain mixing ratios.
