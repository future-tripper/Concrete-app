I built a tool to fight the "Beige Singularity."

Last week, I wrote about how our professional language is flattening. We are all starting to sound like the same "System"—using words like ecosystem, unlock, and coherence to smooth over our differences.

I actually think these words can be powerful.
They have the potential to build bridges between disconnected teams (e.g., a Chef and a Doctor finding a shared language).

But you can't build a bridge out of vapor.
If we use these high-status words without specific meaning, we aren't connecting; we're just painting over the cracks.

So, I spent my weekend building a simple Python tool to help us use them better.

Introducing CONCRETE (Alpha). 🧱

It is a "Grounding Engine" for anyone writing on LinkedIn.

It doesn't tell you not to use big words. It just forces you to earn them.

How it works:
It scans your draft for "Vapor"—abstract nouns and frozen verbs.
But instead of just deleting them, it asks you a Grounding Question:
• You wrote: "We need Alignment."
• Concrete asks: "Who specifically needs to agree, and what is the cost if they don't?"
• You wrote: "Optimize the Ecosystem."
• Concrete asks: "Name three real people inside that ecosystem."

The goal isn't to dumb down our language. It's to power it up. To make sure that when we talk about "systems," we are talking about reality, not just vibes.

I built this using Python and the OpenAI API. 

It’s a small experiment in "Human-in-the-Loop" AI—using the machine to make the human sharper, not flatter.

System functioning... concretely.
