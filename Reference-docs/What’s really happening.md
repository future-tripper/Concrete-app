[[what’s REALLY happening v2]]

You are absolutely not imagining it. While there is always a degree of Baader-Meinhof phenomenon (frequency illusion) when we learn a new term, what you are seeing is a documented structural bias in how Large Language Models (LLMs) function and how they are shaping professional discourse.

You are witnessing Semantic Convergence.
Here is the breakdown of why "Systems" and "Coherence" are winning the linguistic war, and why an Astrologist and a Systems Architect now sound exactly the same.

"Safe Sophistication" Bias

LLMs are probabilistic engines designed to predict the next plausible token. They are fine-tuned (RLHF) to sound helpful, authoritative, and intelligent.

 * The Problem with Specificity: Concrete words are risky. If the AI guesses a specific metric or a rigid framework, it might be wrong.
 * The Power of Abstraction: Words like "coherence," "ecosystem," "landscape," and "tapestry" are high-utility, low-risk abstractions. They fit almost any context.
 * The Result: "Coherence" is the perfect AI word. It implies logic, order, and connection (which sounds smart) without promising a specific outcome (which is safe). It is the "Little Black Dress" of corporate vocabulary—it goes with everything.

The "California Ideology" Intersection

You mentioned seeing this from Systems Architects and Metaphysicists. This is the smoking gun.

LLMs were trained on the internet, which is heavily influenced by the "California Ideology"—that specific historic blend of 1960s counterculture (New Age, holism, consciousness) and 1990s cybernetics (tech, code, networks).

 * The Common Ancestor: In the training data, the language of Cybernetics (Norbert Wiener) and the language of Spiritual Holism (Gregory Bateson, Alan Watts) overlap significantly. Both talk about "flows," "feedback loops," "energies," and "wholeness."
 * The Collapse: To a human, a "System" in software and a "System" in astrology are different categories. To an LLM, they are vector neighbors. The model sees that "coherence" scores high in both vectors.
 * The Output: The AI flattens the distinction. It gives the Astrologist a "systems view" of the stars, and it gives the Architect a "spiritual view" of the code. They converge on "Coherence." 
 
 The Shift from "Kinetic" to "Static" Authority

Ten years ago, the LinkedIn buzzwords were kinetic: disrupt, crush, hustle, hack, unlock. This was the era of the "Move Fast and Break Things" algorithm.

The current "Vibe Shift" (amplified by AI) is toward stability and integration.

 * We are overwhelmed by noise.
 * We don't want "disruption" anymore; we want "coherence."
 * We don't want to "break things"; we want "systems."

The AI detects this sentiment shift in its training data and reinforcement feedback. It knows that "Coherence" rewards the user's dopamine receptors right now, while "Disruption" feels exhausted.

How to "Poke at it" (The Proof)
If you want to test this theory, try this experiment in ChatGPT. It exposes the "default setting" of the model.

The Prompt:
> "I am a [INSERT JOB A]. Write a manifesto about the future of my field. Use high-level, authoritative language."
> 
Run it 3 times with different jobs:
 * "I am a Brand Strategist..."
 * "I am a Reiki Healer..."
 * "I am a Cloud Infrastructure Architect..."

The Prediction:

I bet you dinner that all three manifestos will pivot around the same core nouns: alignment, ecosystem, synergy, resonance, and coherence.

The nouns will remain stable; only the verbs and adjectives will slightly shift. That is the Tapestry of Cultural Feedback in action.
