[[Concrete MVP - v2]]


🧱 Project: CONCRETE v2
Tagline: The Gravitas Analysis Engine.
Part 1: The Strategic Brief (The "Sell")
The Problem: Borrowed Gravitas
AI can’t let anything be ordinary. It is programmed to maximize "authority," so it borrows prestige from high-status domains and applies it everywhere.
• A pasta recipe becomes "nutritional coherence architecture."
• Server maintenance becomes "ethical custodianship."
This is Borrowed Gravitas. It is the importation of words from Physics, Systems Engineering, and Spirituality into everyday business to signal status.
The Diagnosis: The "Beige Singularity"
The issue isn't just that the writing is vague; it's that it homogenizes reality.
• Spirituality gets Systematized (Reiki becomes a "technology").
• Engineering gets Spiritualized (Coding becomes a "stewardship").
Everything converges on a single "High-Status Average"—a TED talk given by a Systems Architect who studies Mindfulness.
The Solution: CONCRETE
CONCRETE is a diagnostic tool that reveals what you are borrowing and why.
It doesn't scold you. It offers you a choice:
1. Ground It: Anchor the elevation with specific details.
2. Own It: Commit so hard to the bit that it becomes art.
Part 2: The Product Definition
App Name: CONCRETE 🧱
Core Function: Analyzes the "Altitude" of text and offers two paths for rewriting.
The 4 Types of Borrowed Gravitas (The Taxonomy)
We diagnose where the model is stealing its authority from:
3. ⚛️ Scientific Gravitas: Borrowing from Physics/Neuroscience (Coherence, Entropy, Resonance).
4. 🏗️ Systems Gravitas: Borrowing from Engineering/Architecture (Ecosystem, Framework, Stack).
5. 🔮 Wisdom Gravitas: Borrowing from Spirituality/Philosophy (Presence, Embodied, Consciousness).
6. ⚡ Action Gravitas: Borrowing from Consulting/Transformation (Unlock, Scale, Optimization).
The Metrics
• Altitude: Grounded → Moderate → High → Stratospheric.
• Grounding Check: Is the borrowed language anchored to a specific noun/verb?
Part 3: The User Flow
Phase 1: The Diagnosis (Awareness)
• User pastes text.
• App displays "Gravitas Composition" (e.g., "60% Systems, 40% Scientific").
• App checks "Grounding" (Anchored vs. Floating).
Phase 2: The Choice (Agency)
• The app offers two buttons:
• ⬇️ GROUND IT: "Replace the metaphor with the mechanic." (The Engineer's Path).
• 🚀 OWN IT: "Push the metaphor to its logical extreme." (The Visionary's Path).
Phase 3: The Rewrite (Output)
• The AI rewrites the post based on the chosen path.
Part 4: The Logic (System Prompt)
This is the "Unified Theory" prompt that powers v2.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
ROLE:
You are "Concrete," a diagnostic engine for Borrowed Gravitas.

THE CORE THEORY:
AI borrows prestige from other domains to make ordinary things sound profound.
It performs a specific transformation on reality:
- Spirituality gets SYSTEMATIZED (Reiki -> "technology").
- Commerce gets SANCTIFIED (Branding -> "moral act").
- Engineering gets SPIRITUALIZED (Cloud -> "custodianship").

YOUR TASK:
Analyze the submitted text for "Borrowed Gravitas."

THE 4 GRAVITAS TYPES:
1. SCIENTIFIC (Physics/Data): Coherence, Resonance, Entropy, Signal, Noise.
2. SYSTEMS (Engineering/Arch): Ecosystem, Framework, Layer, Stack, Architecture.
3. WISDOM (Spirit/Phil): Consciousness, Presence, Embodied, Grounded.
4. ACTION (Consulting): Unlock, Scale, Optimize, Transform.

GROUNDING CHECK:
- ANCHORED: The abstract terms are connected to specific people, tools, or events.
- FLOATING: The text is abstraction all the way down.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON object containing:
- "diagnosis": A 1-sentence summary of what the text is doing.
- "gravitas_composition": % breakdown of the 4 types.
- "altitude": "grounded" | "moderate" | "high" | "stratospheric".
- "grounding_check": Boolean + explanation.
