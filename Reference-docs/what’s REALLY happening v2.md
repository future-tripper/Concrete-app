[[The Coherence Test]]

If “reality is an engineering problem,” why would engineering get *spiritualized*? That’s backwards.

**What’s actually happening:**

AI can’t let anything be ordinary. It adds gravitas to everything by borrowing what each domain lacks:

|Domain      |What it lacks         |AI adds                                        |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|Spirituality|Scientific credibility|→ “technology,” “system,” “regulation”         |
|Commerce    |Moral weight          |→ “ethics,” “stewardship,” “designing behavior”|
|Engineering |Meaning/purpose       |→ “custodianship,” “coherence,” “wisdom”       |

Every domain borrows prestige from another domain. And they all borrow from the same vocabulary: *coherence, systems, alignment, stewardship, architecture.*

The result isn’t “everything becomes engineering.” It’s:

**Everything becomes Important™.**

Everything sounds like a paradigm shift. Everything requires a manifesto. Everything is profound.

The TED talk joke still lands because that’s the convergence point—the register of the Profound Systems Thinker who studied mindfulness.

**Simpler framing for the UI:**

> **AI can’t let anything be ordinary.**
> 
> - Reiki can’t just be a healing practice—it’s “a technology for regulating the nervous system”
> - Branding can’t just be selling—it’s “designing behavior”
> - Server maintenance can’t just be keeping things running—it’s “ethical custodianship”
> 
> Every domain borrows gravitas from somewhere else. All of them end up sounding the same: abstract, elevated, and vague.

That is what is really happening. On the one hand it is creative, keeps things interesting. May even open doors to cross domain understanding. On the other hand, it can be dangerous. But how? And why and when? We need to nail that down and if we do we will know how to update what the app is detecting and how to fix it. Not sure yet if we should make it better by making it more ridiculous at this point. And pivot to “if you’re going to do it do it better”. But for now let’s pin point what the danger is and then discuss the options to make the app funny/absurd with a straight faced tone vs actually helping people think more and make their AI slop/vapor more meaningful.

This is the right question. Let me think through it…

**When is borrowing gravitas dangerous?**

1. **Displacement** — The elevated language REPLACES the actual work instead of illuminating it

- “I’m a custodian of nutritional coherence” vs “I make pasta from scratch using my grandmother’s recipe”
- The first tells you nothing. The second shows real expertise.

1. **Unfalsifiability** — Abstract claims can’t be wrong

- “We need more coherence” — can never be tested
- “We need weekly syncs between sales and engineering” — can be tried and evaluated

1. **Borrowed authority without borrowed rigor**

- Using “coherence” from physics gets you the *prestige* of science without the *discipline*
- In laser physics, coherence is measurable. In life coaching, it’s vibes.

1. **Erosion of trust** — Readers sense the vapor

- Even if they can’t name it, they feel the gap between the Important™ language and the lack of substance
- This is why AI-generated LinkedIn posts feel off—the register is wrong

1. **Homogenization** — No differentiation

- If the Reiki healer and the cloud architect sound the same, neither stands out
- Their actual, specific expertise is invisible

**When is it fine or even good?**

- When the abstract is followed by the specific (“I think of my kitchen as a system—here’s how: mise en place, timing charts, temperature logs”)
- When the cross-domain metaphor genuinely teaches something
- When it’s deliberate and playful, not default and earnest
- When you can also speak concretely—you’re choosing elevation, not hiding behind it

**The core test:**

> *Could someone who doesn’t know your field tell what you actually DO from reading this?*

If no → vapor is displacing substance
If yes → the elevation is earned

-----

**For the app, two directions:**

**A) Straight-faced absurd**: Detect vapor, then offer to make it MORE ridiculous. “You said ‘coherence’—why stop there? Try ‘quantum-entangled coherence field.’ If you’re going to borrow gravitas, go full manifesto.”

**B) Grounding tool**: Detect vapor, explain the borrowing pattern, ask the grounding questions. “You’re borrowing physics vocabulary for a felt practice. That’s fine—but can you also describe what actually happens? What would someone see or feel?”

Or **C) Both**: Expose the pattern, offer both paths. “You can ground this OR you can go full TED talk. Your choice. But don’t do it by accident.”

Which direction feels right?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
